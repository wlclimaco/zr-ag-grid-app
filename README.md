# zr-ag-grid-app
HOSTED APP: Application working on ag-grid using React and Semantic for styling. Redux implementation and React Router. Hosted on Heroku so give it a second it has to spin up new servers if the app hasn't been used in awhile. Feel free to visit the site.

Most of this application is code for a React course. The part that is hosted is some work I did on a grid using ag-grid, which basically allows you to add a nicely styled excel spreadsheet to the front end of an application.

This application uses Redux and it has SPA routing set up, but in prod there is just the home route.

The code for the ag-grid part of the app can be found here:
